# Node.js-TypeScript-Express Boilerplate with Path Alias

i always waste quite a bit of my time when setting up a new node-typescript project with path alias & nodemon configured. i was able to get this shit done and i don't know how most of this works. fuck libraries & the js ecosystem in general.

## Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Start Dev Server (nodemon)

```
npm run dev
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

## Build and Start Server

```
npm start
```
